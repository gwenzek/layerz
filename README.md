# LayerZ a Zig utility to control what your keyboard do

This utility leverage [interception](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools)
a linux utility that intercept the key events from a specific input device.
LayerZ then allow you to rewrite those events on the fly 
and change what the rest of the OS receives as input.

I've got used to be able to program my mechanical keyboard
for a few years now.
And when I've to type on my laptop keyboard
I also want to control exactly what happen
and I want to make some keys easier to reach.

## Get started

`/!\` This software is still in early stage, 
and the user experience need to be improved.

1. Configure which device you want to intercept.
   This allow to eg only intercept events from your laptop keyboard
   and ignore external keyboards.
   To do that edit the `KEEB` variable in [start.sh](./start.sh)

2. Check the keyboard layout and potentially customize it.
   The layout is specified in [main.zig](./main.zig).
   The default layout adds a new layer
   which is activated while holding the space bar.
   Don't hesitate to customize a bit.
   See below for the reference of what you can do.

3. [Install Zig with a package manager](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Manager)
   This code was written with Zig 0.8.0.

4. Identify the name of the builting keyboard.
   Run `ls /dev/input/by-path/` to find the name of the usb devices plugged 
   in your laptop.

5. Run `sudo ./start.sh $KEEB` from a terminal.
   This will build the utility and start intercepting the keyboard events.
   `sudo` is required for the interception.
   If the keyboard is not behaving as you would like
   close the terminal with the mouse :-)

## How to ?

### How to debug issues

The first thing to do is to build Layerz in debug mode.
This will output the received events and the output.
Sometimes the keyboard themselves don't send the correct input.
For instance my laptop keyboard doesn't detect when "space", "capslock" and "f" 
are pressed at the same time.

### I see `libevdev_uinput_write_event failed: Success`

This probably means that you can't write to this device,
is it open in another terminal/process ?
Run `pgrep uinput`.

### How to input a localized character

The keyboard protocol doesn't support localized characters.
Those are generated by XKB.
Typically you should chose a keyboard layout that have special characters when holding "RightAlt".
Then use LayerZ to yield RightAlt and the character of your choice.
If you don't find a keyboard layout that has all the special characters you want,
you will need to modify an exisiting one.
Note that not all applications receives the special characters from XKB.

TODO: could we generate the XKB layout ourselves ?


## Performance

Those numbers varies run by run,
and I guess depends on your layout and which key you press.

Intercept latency: 0.072 ms
Intercept + LayerZ latency (release safe): 0.156 ms
Intercept + LayerZ latency (release fast): 0.135 ms

The difference between release safe and release fast isn't significant.
TODO: make a script that only measure the latency of LayerZ on a 
recorded set of keys
TODO: this seems like a high latency to me. I should profile this.


## Reference

Features:
- `k`: Remap a key to another key 
- Remap a key to two keys (typically shift + key)
  - `s`: Remap a key to a shifted key
  - `ctrl`: Remap a key to ctrl+key
  - `altgr`: Remap a key to a key + altgr. Useful for inputing localized chars.
- `lt`: Layer toggle
- `lh`: Layer hold
- `xx`: Disable a key
- `__`: Don't modify key behavior

**TODO**: allow to input several modifiers
**TODO**: mod hold
**TODO**: add combos (map a combination of keys to another)
**TODO**: add chord (map a succession of keys to another)
**TODO**: make it easy to add a new hook

**TODO**: generate Zig doc for the DSL
